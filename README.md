This is an official implementation of FPGA framework and FreeNet in our TGRS 2020 paper ["FPGA: Fast Patch-Free Global Learning Framework for Fully End-to-End Hyperspectral Image Classification"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9007624).
Hardware-Efficient Deconvolution-Based GAN for Edge Computing    
**SkyNet is published as a conference paper at [Conference on Machine Learning and Systems (MLSys)](https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2020/Schedule?type=Oral).**


### Have a look and the README under the `PyTorch` folder for training, `Hardware` for the synthesis of the accelerator, and `Hardware/Pynq/` for deployment on xilinx SOC-FPGAs having pynq linux.
