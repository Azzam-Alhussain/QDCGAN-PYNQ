This is the official HW/SW Co-design efficient training and implementation of quantized deconvolution GAN (QDCGAN) on PYNQ FPGAs and Jetson nano frameworks that is published as a conference paper in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library as [Hardware-Efficient Deconvolution-Based GAN for Edge Computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) and will be presented at the 56th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS). 


**SkyNet is published as a conference paper at [56th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)](https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2020/Schedule?type=Oral).**


### Have a look and the README under the `PyTorch` folder for training, `Hardware` for the synthesis of the accelerator, and `Hardware/Pynq/` for deployment on xilinx SOC-FPGAs having pynq linux.
