# Hardware-Efficient Deconvolution-Based GAN for Edge Computing    QDCGANs on Xilinx SoC-FPGAs
### [Azzam Alhussain](http://azzam.page/), [Mingjie Lin](https://www.ece.ucf.edu/person/mingjie-lin/)

### Have a look and the README under the `PyTorch` folder for training, `Hardware` for the synthesis of the accelerator, and `Hardware/Pynq/` for deployment on xilinx SOC-FPGAs having pynq linux.
