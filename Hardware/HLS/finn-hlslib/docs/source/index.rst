Introduction
====================================
FINN is an experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs. It specifically targets quantized neural networks, with emphasis on generating dataflow-style architectures customized for each network. It is not intended to be a generic DNN accelerator like xDNN, but rather a tool for exploring the design space of DNN inference accelerators on FPGAs. 

====================================
FINN-HLS content
====================================

The FINN-HLS repository contains the C++ description of multiple layers for the implementation of quantized neural networks using dataflow architecture. 
The library serves as a hardware backend for the FINN project, and it integrates in Xilinx Vivado HLS tool.
